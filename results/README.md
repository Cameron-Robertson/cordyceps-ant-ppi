This contains a folder with the HADDOCK output files of the 4 top ranking PPIs. 



These are protein data bank (PDB) files - 3D structural models of the protein complexes. These need to be viewed using molecular visualisation software, like PyMOL. 



Other HADDOCK docking outputs are not tracked in this repository.



PyMOL was used in this project to view the protein molecules, to trim them, and to assess their active residues.



HADDOCK 2.4 can be used on the web server here:
