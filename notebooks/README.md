This project used the ColabFold notebook which harbours the models AlphaFold2 and AlphaFold-Multimer - used for protein structural predictions and protein-protein interaction predictions, respectively.



Due to size and runtime constraints, notebooks are not stored here. ColabFold was run using the official notebook:
